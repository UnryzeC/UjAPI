UjAPI World Editor 1.0.1.4

1. Fixed UjAPI folder destination incorrectly pointing from WE to Warcraft III.
	Note: this means both Patches / MPQ folders will now work with World Editor.
2. Added "Dark Mode" option.
	Note: this is unfinished and highly experimental.

UjAPI World Editor 1.0.2.9

1. Fixed UjAPI Dark Mode messing up the colour scheme for some other buttons.
2. Added more things to Dark Mode handling.
	Note: TESH's Menubar is broken because of this, this will be resolved someday, to use it disable Dark Mode and re-launch.
3. Fixed Console Logging for loaded .mix/mpqs now it's a straight list along with timestamps.
