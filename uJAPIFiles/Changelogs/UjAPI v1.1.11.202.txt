v1.1.11.202

1. Fixed WIDGET_DEATH events triggering multiple times if an already dead widget was hit.
2. Fixed EVENT_PLAYER_MOUSE_MOVE not returning screen position.
3. KEY/MOUSE down/up handler was moved to WndProc for a more consistent handling.
	Note: this should fix some of the keys being ignored, as now it's not relying on how game handles keys.
4. Added XButton1 support in KEY/MOUSE down/up event.
5. Added XButton2 support in KEY/MOUSE down/up event.
6. SHIFT/LSHIFT/RSHIFT handling fixed. LSHIFT/RSHIFT will fire a separate event after SHIFT.
7. ALT/LALT/RALT handling fixed. LALT/RALT will fire a separate event after ALT.
8. CTRL/LCTRL/RCTRL handling fixed. LCTRL/RCTRL will fire a separate event after CTRL.
9. Fixed a desync issue introduced since 1.1.11.199.
10. Fixed LaunchProjectileAt not saving target axis.
11. Fixed LaunchProjectile not working through SetProjectileTargetPositionWithZ.
12. GetFrameTexture now works with CSimpleFrame.
13. Fixed SetFrameTexture caching CSimpleFrame texture paths, making it unable to change to original texture.
14. Updated UnlockMapSize module to version 1.0.1.3.
