1. Fixed UnitAddBuffById/Ex on stuns/pauses on Illusions, since buffs are "self-cast" and game internally prevents illusions from most of the actions this had to be circumvented.
2. Updated Blizzard.as for newer AngelScript version that can use "using namespace" feature and moved all natives to Jass namespace and all Blizzard functions to BJ namespace.
