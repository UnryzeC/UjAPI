2. Fixed Fatal Error involving OnDamaging/OnDamage event in very badly coded maps (meaning Jass code is very unoptimised).
	Note: the issue was caused by my C++ code optimisation, I was freeing the data in a "as soon as possible" manner, which resulted being too fast.
3. Fixed Fatal Error when selecting shops/hero ability (Aher)/spellbook, etc.
	Note: this error was introduced due to a "workaround" implementation of extremely experimental SetAbilityOrderId.
