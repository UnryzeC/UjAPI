v1.0.40.147

1. New Natives:
	native GetWheelDelta									takes nothing returns integer
	native GetVisionMax 									takes nothing returns real
	native SetVisionMax 									takes real value returns nothing
2. Fixed fatal error from GetAbilityStringField when used on abilities that have a singular tip/ubertip/etc. while having more than 1 level.
	Note: this is related to slk optimisation.
3. Added a reallocation method for Tip/Ubertip/Untip/Unubertip texts for multi-level abilities if no level data was provided.
	Example: "Ubertip=text", this means all levels will share "text" as ubertip, however internally only 1 index will be allocated.
4. Re-Re-fixed SetDestructableZ, this broke yet again due to a fix related to other widgets.
5. Fixed CreateBuff/UnitAddBuff/UnitAddBuffEx/UnitAddBuffById/UnitAddBuffByIdEx not working with SLK-optimised maps.
6. Hooked CreateImage, now it uses CreateImageSimple internally, so resizing the image will no longer break it.
