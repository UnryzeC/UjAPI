1. Rewritten CLI handling, now it should work without issues.
  Note: it was breaking if specific order wasn't followed.
2. Fixed AInv being ignored by GetUnitAbility.
3. Added internal categorisation of Projectiles, this allows for a faster lookup and removes the need to use game's IsDescendant usage, which is very-very slow.
4. Reworked internal structures of projectiles, also streamline Launch logic.
5. Artillery launch logic fixed, now it uses correct offset instead of relying on CMissile.
6. Fixed GitHub's 401 error.
