v1.0.4.22

1. native IsAbilityShown changed to IsAbilityVisible.
2. All return types of Setters in AbilityAPI changed to "nothing" from integer, since the returned data was bogus anyways.
3. New natives:
	native I2C												takes integer i returns code
	native C2I												takes code c returns integer

	native MathRound										takes real r returns integer

	native MathRealRound									takes real r returns real
	native MathRealFloor									takes real r returns real
	native MathRealCeil										takes real r returns real
	native MathRealAbs										takes real r returns real
	native MathRealLog										takes real r returns real
	native MathRealLn										takes real r returns real

	native MathIntegerAbs									takes integer i returns integer
	native MathIntegerLog									takes integer i returns real
	native MathIntegerLn									takes integer i returns real

	native StringContains									takes string s, string whichString returns boolean
	native StringFind										takes string s, string whichString returns integer
	native StringFindFirstOf								takes string s, string whichString returns integer
	native StringFindFirstNotOf								takes string s, string whichString returns integer
	native StringFindLastOf									takes string s, string whichString returns integer
	native StringFindLastNotOf								takes string s, string whichString returns integer

	native IsOperationLimitEnabled							takes nothing returns boolean
	native EnableOperationLimit								takes boolean enable returns nothing
	native ExecuteFuncEx									takes string funcName returns nothing

	native GetUnitDamageReduction 							takes unit whichUnit returns real
	native IsUnitAbilityVisible 							takes unit whichUnit, integer abilityId returns integer
	native ShowUnitAbility 									takes unit whichUnit, integer abilityId, boolean flag returns nothing
4. Decyphered these natives:
	native SilenceAbility 									takes ability whicAbility, boolean hide, boolean disable returns nothing
	native UnsilenceAbility 								takes ability whicAbility, boolean show, boolean enable returns nothing
Now their arguments have proper names.
5. Fixed native GetUnitAblity, it would fail to grab ability if it had more than 1 level or if it was not HeroAbil.
6. Re-refixed SpecialEffectAPI x/y/z setters.
7. Fixed native IsAbilityOnCooldown, was comparing wrong flags, hence returning bogus result.
8. Fixed native IsFrameVisible, was returning inverse value instead.
9. Fixed native SetUnitCurrentSight.
10. TriggerRegisterFrameEvent now works properly and actually creates a new event for the said frame.
	Note: not all events are fully supported yet and for now frameEvents are local, soon they will work in multiplayer too.
11. Fixed fatal error whenever Neutral Passive unit was damaged.
12. Fixed fatal error on map launch on 1.28.5.
