constant unitweaponintegerfield 	UNIT_WEAPON_IF_ATTACKS_ENABLED                  			= ConvertUnitWeaponIntegerField('uaen')
2. New Natives:
native DisplayChatMessage								takes player whichPlayer, integer recipient, string message returns nothing
native DisplayTimedChatMessage							takes player whichPlayer, integer recipient, string message, real duration returns nothing
native SetSpecialEffectAnimationOffsetPercent 			takes effect whichEffect, real percent returns boolean
native SetTrackableAnimationOffsetPercent 				takes trackable whichTrackable, real percent returns boolean
native SetWidgetAnimationOffsetPercent 					takes widget whichWidget, real percent returns boolean
native SetDestructableAnimationOffsetPercent 			takes destructable whichDestructable, real percent returns boolean
native SetItemAnimationOffsetPercent 					takes item whichItem, real percent returns boolean
native SetUnitAnimationOffsetPercent 					takes unit whichUnit, real percent returns boolean
native SetMissileAnimationOffsetPercent 				takes missile whichMissile, real percent returns boolean
3. SetFrameSpriteAnimationOffset changed to SetFrameSpriteAnimationOffsetPercent.
4. Fixed all natives related to fields, none of them were working.
5. Fixed fatal error on map exit/restart when any frame was created via CreateFrame, CreateSimpleFrame and CreateFrameByType natives with duplicate contextId.
	Note: meaning if you create a frame like so: CreateFrame( "SomFrame", gameUI, 0, 0 ) and do it again CreateFrame( "SomFrame", gameUI, 0, 0 ), it was essentially "popping" previous frame, which is no longer the case.
