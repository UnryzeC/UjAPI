1. Fully rewritten Tip/Ubertip parser for maximum efficiency.
2. Fixed case where $DataA,%$% wouldn't work and required $A00B,DataA,%$%.
  Note: this just means that supplying typeId was required for % value token.
3. Fixed SetFrameState on normal frames (only ones that extend CControl) to properly set control flags. It was effectively doing nothing.
4. Fixed EnumSpecialEffectsInRange not working at all apart from .0, .0 axis.
