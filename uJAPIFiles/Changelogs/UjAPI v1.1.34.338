1. New Natives:
    native GetFogHeartbeat									takes nothing returns real
    native StartFogHeartbeat								takes boolean isStart, real time returns nothing
    //
    native GetPlayerPathingLimit							takes player whichPlayer, integer queueType returns integer // 0 - deep | 1 - dynamic | 2 - fast | 3 - local
    native SetPlayerPathingLimit							takes player whichPlayer, integer value returns nothing // Set for all
    native SetPlayerPathingLimitEx							takes player whichPlayer, integer queueType, integer value returns nothing
    //
    native GetUnitTurnRate									takes unit whichUnit returns real
    native SetUnitTurnRate									takes unit whichUnit, real turnRate returns nothing
    native IsUnitTurningOnly								takes unit whichUnit returns boolean
    native UnitAllowMove									takes unit whichUnit returns nothing
    native UnitAllowTurningOnly								takes unit whichUnit returns nothing
    native GetUnitPathingLimit								takes unit whichUnit, integer level returns integer // Levels: 0 or 1.
    native SetUnitPathingLimit								takes unit whichUnit, integer level, integer limit returns nothing // Limit is 0 to 32,767 (anything lower than 0 will default to -32,767). Use -1 (or any other negative number) to "erase" limit.
2. Fixed SetTYPEFacing not setting internal Position::Facing, hence causing GetTYPEFacing to not work properly.
3. Fixed SetX/Y not working for destructables.
4. Fixed PauseUnitEx not unpausing units.
5. Fixed crash related to SetFrameStepSize on SLIDER frame type.
6. Added internal CArtillery::SetData, now it can be properly copied and fired.
7. Fixed GetUnitBonusDamageByIndex breaking whenever bonus attack was awarded from main stat.
8. Fixed Mouse API not working when Cursor Frame was not present, either at the very start of the game or when cursor is outside of the game window.
9. Fixed internal CAbility::CloneBase not returning cloned base and defaulting to nullptr instead, when base was already cloned.
10. Added internal edits to Pathing and Fog heartbeat constants, to ensure their work. (Pathing seemed to be just fine).
11. Added internal lock for SetUnitControlCount whenever a value is set to less than 0 to default to 0. Any value below 0 breaks internal counters.
