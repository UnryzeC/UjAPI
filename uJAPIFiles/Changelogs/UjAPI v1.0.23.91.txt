2. CSimpleTexture can now be created via CreateFrameByType, with "SIMPLETEXTURE" frameType name.
3. CSimpleFontString can now be created via CreateFrameByType, with "SIMPLETEXT" frameType name.
4. FRAMEEVENT_MOUSE_DOWN and FRAMEEVENT_MOUSE_UP are properly implemented for CSimpleButtons and all its children types.
5. Fixed not working Frame API for CScrollBar.
6. Fixed inversed flag in BlzUnitHideAbility.
7. Fixed all custom/new events only working with latest added trigger event.
	Thanks to Radioactive for spotting this issue.
8. Re-fixed CSpellbook interactions and ABILITY_SF_FIELD_ABILITY_LIST.
9. Fixed fatal error on map load on 1.27a/1.27b/1.28f.
	Note: this was a new bug introduced due to the removal of RCString limit.
10. Fixed SetAbilityString not invoking ability UI data cloning.
11. Fixed StringReplace replacing only 1 occurence instead of all.
12. Fixed StringReplace not working if replacement string was empty.
13. Slightly increased wait time for packet handling, this should prevent UjAPI sometimes failing to launch the map provided in the launch arguments.
14. Added Jass section in UjAPI app.
15. Added Dev Mode in Jass Section. This will cause UjAPI to print to console current running Jass function.
16. Added Log Actions in Jass Section. This will cause UjAPI to print any and all Jass actions to console.
	Example: ADD real -> -2816.000000 + 512.000000 = -2304.000000.
	Note: there are a total of 43 different types of operations (opcodes).
17. Added "-jass" CLI option to access new features such as Dev Mode and Log Actions.
18. Added "dev" option to "-jass" CLI option.
	Example: "-jass dev".
19. Added "logactions" option to "-jass" CLI option.
	Example: "-jass logactions".
20. Get/SetFrameAlpha should work with CSimpleFrames that have textures and with all CSimpleRegions
