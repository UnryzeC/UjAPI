1. Fixed issue that caused game to instantly close, this was related to vtable overriding of CAbilityAttributeBonus.
  Note: those who used map size unlocker did not experience this issue.
2. Reworked how abilities are handled, now if you remove owner of the ability/buff and then return it, it will actually retain all custom data.
