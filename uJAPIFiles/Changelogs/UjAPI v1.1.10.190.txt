1. New Types:
	type framestate 										extends flagtype
2. New Convertors:
	constant native ConvertFrameState						takes integer i returns framestate
3. New Constants:
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_SIMPLE_BUTTON_ENABLED							= ConvertFrameState(0)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_SIMPLE_BUTTON_DISABLED							= ConvertFrameState(1)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_SIMPLE_BUTTON_PUSHED							= ConvertFrameState(2)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_SIMPLE_BUTTON_CURRENT							= ConvertFrameState(3)
	//
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_CONTROL_CURRENT									= ConvertFrameState(0)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_CONTROL_ENABLED									= ConvertFrameState(1)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_CONTROL_PUSHED									= ConvertFrameState(2)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_CONTROL_DISABLED								= ConvertFrameState(3)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_CONTROL_CHECK_ENABLED							= ConvertFrameState(5)
	constant framestate					FRAME_STATE_CONTROL_CHECK_DISABLED							= ConvertFrameState(6)
4. New Natives:
	native GetFrameState									takes framehandle whichFrame returns framestate
	native SetFrameState									takes framehandle whichFrame, framestate whichFrameState returns nothing
5. Fixed fatal error from SetFramePriority on CSimpleFrames if priority was higher than 8.
6. Fixed fatal error from SetFramePriority on CSimpleRegions if priority was higher than 4.
7. Fixed inversed behaviour of SetFrameEnabled with CSimpleButtons.
