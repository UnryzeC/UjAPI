1. Fixed fatal error from CancelResearchAt.
2. Fixed internal error in CAbilityQueue::CancelAt that was causing fatal error.
3. UnitApplyTimedLife now fully supports custom Buffs.
4. Rewritten all internal node-based loops from while to for.
  Note: mostly QoL for my own eyes.
5. UnitCancelTimedLife no longer makes unit cost food, this should have been in control of the mapmaker instead.
