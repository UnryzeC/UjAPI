v1.0.36.132

1. New Natives:
	native GetStringCount									takes nothing returns integer
	native IsUnitTargetable									takes unit whichUnit returns boolean
	native SetUnitTargetable								takes unit whichUnit, boolean targetable returns nothing
	native GetFrameTextColourEx								takes framehandle whichFrame, integer stateId returns integer // 0 = font | 1 = highlighted | 2 = disabled | 3 = shadow
	native GetFrameTextColour								takes framehandle whichFrame returns integer
	native SetFrameTextColourEx								takes framehandle whichFrame, integer stateId, integer colour returns nothing
2. Major code optimisation for Frame API, additionally removed a lot of redundant code.
3. Rewritten GetFrameWidth, now it properly operates on all frames and no longer causes a fatal error on certain frame types.
4. Rewritten GetFrameHeight, now it properly operates on all frames and no longer causes a fatal error on certain frame types.
5. IsFrameEnabled now returns if CSimpleButton and its children are enabled/disabled.
6. Fixed Fatal Error whenever any unit attacking with Artillery Attack type, while having any Orb-effect.
	Note: this is a very old fatal error of the game itself.
7. Fixed Fatal Error whenever any non-hero unit would pick up Strength Bonus runes/books, etc.
8. Fixed Fatal Error whenever any non-hero unit would pick up Agility Bonus runes/books, etc.
9. Fixed Fatal Error whenever any non-hero unit would pick up Intelligence Bonus runes/books, etc.
10. Fixed Fatal Error whenever any non-hero unit would pick up Experience Bonus runes/books, etc.
11. Fixed Fatal Error whenever any non-hero unit would learn Engineering (ANeg).
12. Fixed Fatal Error whenever Life Drain/Mana syphon was casted via CastAbilityTarget and "caster" (ability's owner) would move.
13. Potentially fixed an extremely rare bug, that would cause a specific player unable to control his units, but was able to control other units.
	Note 1: other players somehow CAN control units of that player, so the issue is local.
	Note 2: this did not seem to be connected to any of the Player Controls.
