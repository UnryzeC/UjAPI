v1.1.2.163

1. New Natives:
	native TextFileRead										takes textfilehandle whichTextFile returns string
	native UnitAddItemToSlot								takes unit whichUnit, item whichItem, integer itemSlot returns boolean
	native ReviveUnit										takes unit whichUnit, real x, real y returns boolean
	native ReviveUnitLoc									takes unit whichUnit, location loc returns boolean
2. TextFileReadAll renamed to TextFileReadAllLines, now it properly reads text, not the file itself.
3. Added experimental support for CSimpleFrame in CBackdropFrame API.
4. Fixed fatal error from SetModel natives, this was caused by non-Ex variants improperly handling colour.
5. Added more precise, yet slightly lenient internal check for Agent being active (not removed).
	Note: this mostly affects new Unit API that was extremely strict with hidden/dead/removed units.
