3. Added missing constants from previous version.
4. Added UjAPI version text to Warcraft's main menu.
5. Added "Load Library" setting for main section. This will simply enable/disable load of UjAPI.mpq and its natives.
	Note: this is by default enabled and toggling it on already launched WC3 will do nothing.
6. Added "Load Library" setting for LUA section. This will enable/disable loading of war3_lua.dll.
	Note: this is by default disabled and toggling it on already launched WC3 will do nothing.
7. Added "CLI" capability to UjAPI, now any subsequent launches of UjAPI will instead send the launch arguments to the "main" program.
	Example 1: "D:\Files\Work Files\Programming\uJAPI\Release\UjAPILauncher.exe" -ujapi "dev" -lua "dev console nowarnings" -multiwindow -window -loadfile "Maps\Test\WorldEditTestMap.w3x"
		Note 1: This will run UjAPI and enable its Developer mode, also it will load lua with provided settings, make it multiwindow, and windowed mode. Then it will launch map provided in loadfile argument.
	Example 2 (full): "D:\Files\Work Files\Programming\uJAPI\Release\UjAPILauncher.exe" -ujapi "dev" -lua "dev console nowarnings" -multiwindow -window -launch "Warcraft" -gamepath "D:\Games\Warcraft III TFT\war3.exe" -loadfile "Maps\Test\WorldEditTestMap.w3x"
		Note 2: This will run everything as stated in Note 1, however it will also override any install path selected in UjAPI.exe if -gamepath or -editorpath are present.
8. CLI commands:
	Note: explanations of the commands will be in brackets, like so - (information).
	-justdoupdate (will simply do force re-download and update of UjAPI, rest of the commands will be ignored).
	-ujapi (opens setting of some UjAPI specific settings, like so: -ujapi "dev"), "" are required!
		noload (disables UjAPI.mpq and UjAPI natives from loading).
		dev (enables Developer mode, which will also enable console).
	-lua (opens setting of war3_lua.dll module data, like so: -lua "dev console nowarnings"), "" are required!
		dev (enables developer mode).
		console (enables lua console printing).
		nowarnings (disables some of the internal type warnings).
	-multiwindow (enables Multi-Window option and loads required module).
	-window (will start process in window mode).
	-launch (allows to specify if we want to launch Game or Editor, by default it launches the Game, like so: -launch "Editor"), "" are required!
	-gamepath (overrides Install Path option from UjAPI Launcher and uses it instead, like so: -gamepath "D:\Games\Warcraft III TFT\war3.exe"), "" are required!
	-editorpath (overrides Install Path option from UjAPI Launcher and uses it instead, like so: -editorpath "D:\Programs\WC3 Tools\JNPG-R1.4-Prometheus-Edition\NewGen WE.exe"), "" are required!
	-loadfile (mimics 1 to 1 whatever Warcraft does to launch any given map, the path is ALWAYS relative to the provided game/editor path).
9. Added -loadfile command for World Editor Section setting, however the path has to be full, it is NOT relative to Warcraft 3.
10. Added Load Library option to World Editor Section.
11. Added Dev Mode to World Editor Section.
	Note: both #10 and #11 work exactly as options for Warcraft 3.
