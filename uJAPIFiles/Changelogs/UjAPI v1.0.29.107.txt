v1.0.29.107

1. Fixed WFE Fast Menu breaking when injected via AutoInjector.
	Note: this happened because UjAPI had some code to also enable/disable fast menu, it's disabled for now.
2. Fixed UjAPI being unable to launch/inject with Frozen Throne.exe.
	Note: it is still recommened to use War3.exe instead of it for patches below 1.28.
3. Starting from next version, UjAPI should have no more issues with being able to remove older app after updating.
