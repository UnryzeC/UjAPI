v1.1.21.246

1. New Natives:
	native AntiHackEnableAddressCheck						takes boolean enable returns nothing
	native AntiHackEnableBreakpointCheck					takes boolean enable returns nothing
	native SetUnitAnimationWithRarityByIndex				takes unit whichUnit, integer animIndex, raritycontrol rarity returns nothing
	native QueueUnitAnimationByIndex						takes unit whichUnit, integer animIndex returns nothing
2. Removed Natives:
	native AntiHackEnableEx									takes boolean enable, boolean isModuleCheck, boolean isProcessCheck returns nothing
3. Fixed somewhat incorrect process of Command Bar drawing, which caused duplicate X/Y coordinates of buttons to fail to draw.
4. Fixed Blizzard.as InitNeutralBuildings having index out of bounds on line 9467.
5. Native GetHeroMaxLevelExperienceNeeded renamed to GetHeroExperienceCurrent.
6. Native GetHeroExperienceNeeded renamed to GetHeroExperienceRequiredAt.
7. Removed CBulletBase (+w3B) from createable Projectile types.
8. Removed CBulletPath (+wbp) from createable Projectile types.
9. Fixed CBullet crash on launch.
	Note: it is advised to use CMissile instead, CBullet serves as base and is less configurable than CMissile.
10. Added hook to CItem::PushToWorldFrameAVC, this list is unused by the game and causes the game to actually leak CItem memory, not allowing it to re-use removed items.
	Note: thanks to IceFog for this discovery.
11. Added hook to CUnit::UnitIssuedOrder to prevent CUnitOrderEventData from leaking whenever too many orders are processed.
12. Added hook to CUnit::UnitIssuedPointOrder to prevent CUnitOrderPointEventData from leaking whenever too many orders are processed.
13. Added hook to CUnit::UnitIssuedTargetOrder to prevent CUnitOrderTargetEventData from leaking whenever too many orders are processed.
14. Applied some security fixes to textfilehandle internal logic.
15. Fixed TextFileOpen not working properly with files in MPQ/Maps/Patches.
16. Fixed fatal error on EVENT_PLAYER_TRADE_RESOURCE on 1.27b and 1.28f.
17. Fixed GetMouseScreenPixelX returning GetMouseScreenX values instead.
18. Fixed GetMouseScreenPixelY returning GetMouseScreenY values instead.
19. Fixed SetMouseScreenPixelX calling SetMouseScreenX instead.
20. Fixed SetMouseScreenPixelY calling SetMouseScreenY instead.
21. Fixed SetMouseScreenPixelPosition calling SetMouseScreenPosition instead.
22. Fixed fatal error whenever a unit walks in shallow water near the edge on maximum sized map by JNGP (above default limit).
	Note: this is caused by game removing shadow from over the limit of the map, thus causing crash.
23. Fixed some internal Damage Flag processing, this fixes incorrect value returned by GetEventIsAttack in AngelScript.
24. AntiHackEnable now only enables/disables thread for the AntiHack, now it needs to be fully configured.
25. Fixed HandleListEnumProjectilesInRange/HandleListEnumProjectilesInRangeOfLoc/HandleListEnumProjectilesInRect not working properly.
26. Fixed HandleListEnumEffectsInRange/HandleListEnumEffectsInRangeOfLoc/HandleListEnumEffectsInRect not working properly.

UjAPI World Editor 1.0.2.9

1. Fixed UjAPI Dark Mode messing up the colour scheme for some other buttons.
2. Added more things to Dark Mode handling.
	Note: TESH's Menubar is broken because of this, this will be resolved someday, to use it disable Dark Mode and re-launch.
3. Fixed Console Logging for loaded .mix/mpqs now it's a straight list along with timestamps.
4. This is the last update for World Editor module in UjAPI.zip, the rest will be separate in its own Resource.
