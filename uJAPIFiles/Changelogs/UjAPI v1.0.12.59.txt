v1.0.12.59

1. Fixed fatal error on 1.28.5.
	Note: this was related to any action being done, such as clicking system frames, selecting unit, etc. Just moving mouse around and camera wouldn't cause a crash.
2. Fixed CastAbilityGround and CastAbilityTarget natives.
	Note: do NOT use these without any delay from main function, as the game might not have enough time to register events, etc.
3. Fixed fatal error with any frame creation native on lua for war3_lua.dll.
