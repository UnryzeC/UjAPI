4. Fixed GetUnitStringField always returning "Default String" with UNIT_SF_HERO_ABILITY_LIST.
5. Fixed UNIT_SF_ABILITY_LIST always returning "Default String" with UNIT_SF_HERO_ABILITY_LIST.
6. GetTriggerPlayerMouseWorldX/Y/Z disabled by default to save 12 bytes in netCode. Use SetMouseMoveEventWorldAxisEnabled to enable it.

8. Fixed TRIGSTR_ not being properly processed in SetTextTagText.
9. Added hook on CGameState::ToHandle.
10. Fixed crash for maps that had 1.29+ w3i, this crash is related to maximum Player Id.
11. SetFramePriority no longer works on CSimpleRegions, as they do not have priority, this option was in fact changing blendmode.
