1. Fixed IsUnitMoving always returning true.
2. Fixed IsUnitIdle always returning false.
3. Changed GetCurrentAnimationId/GetCurrentAnimationName handling to only use CModel, instead of relying on CSprite.
4. Yet another, this time for sure switch to AbilDataCacheNode::Clone, to prevent crashes.
5. Rewamped how AbilDataCacheNode clones are erased, allowing ability to get properly cleanup first and then removing cloned base.
