8. Fixed GetWindowX/Y returning incorrect value when game was launched in windowed mode.
9. Fixed GetWindowCenterX/Y returning incorrect value when game was launched in windowed mode.
10. Fixed initial item button drawing, which would fail for the first unit with inventory.
11. Fixed random fatal error on item pickup, it was related to incorrect process of ability count.
12. Items no longer remove abilities on drop, they are instead simply stripped from their owner, so they can be re-used.
13. SetItemStringField with ITEM_SF_ABILITY_LIST is now instance specific, instead of being global.
14. Huge inside remake of code, this won't really yield much of a change on performance, just developer's note.
