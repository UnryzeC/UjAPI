1. Fixed fatal error on pop up frame events.
2. Fixed incorrect projectile launching, it was resetting to default values on each launch. Now all settings persist.
3. Fixed enumeration for HandleList failing if null/nil Filter/Condition was passed.
4. Fixed incorrect area calculation, which was supposed to be done via radius and diameter was used instead.
5. Fixed SetIllusionDamageDealt not working with custom Item Illusion buffs.
6. Fixed SetIllusionDamageReceived not working with custom Item Illusion buffs.
7. Fixed SetMouseScreenAbsoluteY being mirrored. (Same for position, only Y axis was wrong).
8. Fixed SyncData triggering all registered SyncData events.
  Note: other sync events were overhauled as well, now they should work a tad better.
